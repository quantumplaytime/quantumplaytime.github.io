# About this website
This website serves as my portfolio, featuring my webcomic [webcomic], other art I do, and even other websites I develop.

Currently, this website is built with Jekyll & deployed with Github Pages. I also use a CSS framework called Bulma, which is why my site looks very bare bones and "clean" at the moment.

If you'd like to learn more on how to build a website w/ Jekyll & Github pages, check out my resources section.
